⏱️ Minut — Mindful time for meaningful work

A gentle space to pause, focus, and create with intention.

🌿 What is Minut?

Minut (Romanian for “minute”) is a mindful productivity app that helps you slow down, work with intention, and understand where your time goes.
Instead of pushing you to do more, Minut encourages you to be present with the work you already care about.

Choose a project → pick a focus system → start a calm, guided session.
Minut quietly tracks your progress and reflects it back to you with clarity and warmth.

✨ Features

Project-based focus tracking
Every project gets its own sessions, stats, and progress.

Two mindful focus systems

20 / 20 / 20 method — focus • move • reflect

25 / 5 method — the classic Pomodoro-style rhythm

Calming animations & a soft UI
GSAP-powered transitions, flowing gradients, minimal visual noise.

Automatic session logging
When a session ends, Minut logs all tracked seconds to your project.
